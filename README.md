[x] Display moving data on a map using GrapQL data source. You can use Entur`s GraphQL vehicle data (not protobuf) or find a GraphQL websocket dataset on your own.

### When the zoom is closer than 10 the vehicles will animate instead of teleporting
### Due to enturs low polling rate it sometimes seems like everything is standing still
### Clicking on a vehicle will show the fylke the vehicle is in it will also show some other available interresting information if available
